    uint public pNumber = 5; //variable that stores a positive number

    function modValue(uint _newVal) public {

/*
STRUCT
A struct in solidity is a custom datatype that allows you to group different pieces of information together under one name. Example;

struct ToDo {
    string activity;
    bool completed;
}

MAPPING
A mapping in solidity is a key-value data structure that allows you to store and look up values using aa specific key. For example you can store tasks using a number as the key;

mapping(uint=> string) public activities;
activities[0] = "buy groceries"

MAIN DIFFERENCE
The main difference is that a struct can hold multiple pieces of related information together as one unit, while a mapping is used to look up a single value using a key. Structs are useful when you want to store detailed information about an item, whereas mappings are useful when you want fast access to a value based on a key.
